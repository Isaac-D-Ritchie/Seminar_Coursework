#Practacing the funimentals of Python

# *For the porposes of this exam prep i have generated a question from chatgpt.com to cover the parameters of the topics taught in weeks 1 - 3.*

# Write a Python program that does the following:
#	1.	Add a comment at the top describing what the program does.
#	2.	Ask the user to enter an integer.
#	3.	Convert the input to an int, and also to a float.
#	4.	Use an arithmetic operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 3.
#	5.	Use if / elif / else to print:
#	    •	"Fizz" if divisible by 3,
#	    •	"Buzz" if divisible by 5,
#	    •	"FizzBuzz" if divisible by both,
#	    •	otherwise, "Not divisible by 3 or 5".
#	6.	Use a logical operator (and) in your condition for FizzBuzz.
#	7.	Use a for loop with range() to print the numbers from 1 up to the user’s number.
#	8.	Create a simple function that takes two numbers and returns their connected string using "+". Call this function with your int and float.


#In this code i will be taking a users number input, converting it into a int and a float, i will then see if that number is devisible by 3 or 5 and print "fizz" if devisible by 3, "buzz" of devisiable by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if devisible by both. Otherwise output "Not devisible by 3 or 5".
#I will then use a for loop to output numbers 1 up until the user input.
#Fiinally i will create a function that takes two inputs and output their connected strings and input the previously created integer and float input

user_input =input("please input a integer: ")
user_integer = int(user_input)
user_float = float(user_input)
